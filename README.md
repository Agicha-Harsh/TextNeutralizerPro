Project: Sentiment Analysis on Reviews

This project performs sentiment analysis on customer reviews and exposes functionality via an API. It includes data exploration, model training, and serving predictions.

ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

Reviews.csv â†’ Dataset containing text reviews.

Sentiment-analysis.ipynb â†’ Main notebook for training and analyzing sentiments.

Sentiment-analysis-tests.ipynb â†’ Notebook for testing model predictions.

sentment.py â†’ Core Python script for sentiment classification logic.

api_code.py â†’ Exposes the sentiment model as an API (so other apps can call it).

downloader.py â†’ Helper script for fetching datasets or dependencies.

test.py â†’ Additional test cases.

Figure_1.png â†’ A generated graph (likely showing results such as word frequency, accuracy, or sentiment distribution).

ðŸ”§ Workflow

Data Loading
Reads reviews from Reviews.csv.

Preprocessing

Tokenization

Stopword removal

Lowercasing, stemming/lemmatization

Model Training

Machine Learning model (likely Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or similar).

Trains on labeled reviews for positive/negative sentiment.

Evaluation

Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.

Visual results stored in Figure_1.png.

API Exposure

Using api_code.py, you can send text to the API and get sentiment back (positive, negative, maybe neutral).
